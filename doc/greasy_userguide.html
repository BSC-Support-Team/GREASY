<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Greasy is a tool designed to make easier the deployment of
embarrassingly parallel simulations in any environment. It is able to
run in parallel a list of different tasks, schedule them and run them
using the available resources. It is the perfect tool to use, for
example, when your application is a serial program, and you need to run
a large number of instances with different parameters. Greasy packs all
these separate runs and uses the resources granted to run as many tasks
as possible in parallel. As this tasks finish, Greasy will continue
starting the tasks that were waiting for resources.</p>

<p>Since one of the main principles of Greasy is to keep it simple for the
user, the list of tasks is just that: a list of tasks in a text file.
Then, each line in the file becomes a task to be run by Greasy. It is
able to manage dependencies between tasks, or to rerun a task in case of
failure if desired.</p>

<p>Greasy can be easily configured by default with a configuration file,
and can be also customized for each particular execution using
environment variables. It also provides a log system where all greasy
actions will be recorded to keep track of what is the progress of your
run.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<h3 id="howtoinstallgreasy">How to install Greasy</h3>

<p>Greasy can be installed in any Linux machine or cluster. However,
additional requirements may be necessary depending on the features
desired:</p>

<ul>
<li>SLURM: If available, Greasy can use it to spawn tasks to remote
nodes inside a job.</li>
<li>SSH: If available, Greasy can use it to spawn tasks to remote nodes.</li>
<li>MPI: If available, Greasy comes with an engine working over MPI that
may be used to run the tasks in a cluster.</li>
</ul>

<p>If none of these packages is available and usable, Greasy will only be
able to run tasks using the local node. The standard installation
procedure is:</p>

<pre><code>tar xvzf greasy-X.Y.tar.gz
cd greasy-X.Y
./configure --prefix=&lt;path-to-greasy-installation-dir&gt;
make
make install
</code></pre>

<p>Additional configuration options may be specified to configure in order
to enable the additional engines to the greasy runtime. See ./configure
&#8211;help for details.</p>

<h3 id="installationstructure">Installation structure</h3>

<p>We will call GREASY_HOME to the root directory of the installation.
Once installed, a Greasy installation will contain the following files
under this directory structure:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>bin</em>/</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>greasy</strong>: The program wrapper that runs greasy.</li>
<li><strong>greasybin</strong>: The actual binary. It must not be called
directly, but from the wrapper greasy.</li>
<li><strong>greasycolorlog</strong>: Utility script to give some color to the
greasy logfiles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>etc</em>/</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>greasy.conf</strong>: Global configuration file.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>doc</em>/</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>greasy_userguide.pdf</strong>: This file.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>example</em>/</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>bsc_greasy.*.job</strong>: An example of job scripts to submit
Greasy to the batch system. It is also valid to run Greasy
interactively in any machine.</li>
<li><strong>short-example.txt</strong>: a very short example of task file.</li>
<li><strong>example.txt</strong>: an example of task file containing both valid
and invalid tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="greasyusage">Greasy Usage</h2>

<h3 id="writingthetaskfile">Writing the task file</h3>

<p>The task file is the most important element, as here the user defines
the tasks to be executed. As mentioned before, each line of the file
becomes a task from Greasy&#8217;s point of view. This way, each line contains
exactly what you want to execute, for example, the path to the binary
followed by the arguments with the necessary redirections. The line
number corresponds to what we call the task ID. This task ID is useful
to understand the log file and when dependencies are needed.</p>

<p>Lines starting with # are treated as comments, and are not processed,
but still reserve an ID. That means, for example, if you have the first
line commented and the second line contains a valid task, then this task
will have ID=2. This way, it is easy to use an editor to show the file
line numbers (ie: vim), and address any task through its task ID just
jumping into the corresponding file line number.</p>

<p>Working directory is specified at the beginning of the line, preceding
the task command and between [@ and @]. This syntax allows to execute
the task in the directory specified. As an example:</p>

<pre><code>task 1 # executed on the directory which greasy has been launched from
[@ /home/user/greasy @] task 2 # executes “cd /home/user/greasy &amp;&amp; task 2”
</code></pre>

<p>Dependencies are specified at the beginning of the line, right before
the task and between <strong>[#</strong> and <strong>#]</strong>. All tasks that must end
before the current task must be included here, and more than one task
may be included as a dependency. The best way to understand dependency
syntax is through an example. This is an example task file with some
dependencies among tasks:</p>

<pre><code>task 1
[# 1 #] task 2
[# -2, 2 #] task 3
task 4
[# 2-4 #] task 5
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, tasks 1 and 4 do not have any dependencies. Task 2 depends
on task 1, and task 3 depends on tasks 1 and 2. Note that with the “-2”
we specify a relative dependency: the parent task is the one 2 lines
above, which is task 1. And finally, task 5 depends on tasks 2, 3 and 4.
In this case, we specified the dependencies as a range. Remember that
you can add more dependencies separating the elements with commas, as in
task 3.</p>

<p>It is important to point out that only backward dependencies are
allowed. That means that you can only add dependencies to tasks with ID
less than the current task ID. In other words, you can only add
dependencies to tasks defined in previous lines in the task file.</p>

<p>In summary, when writing a Greasy task file, just keep in mind these
simple rules:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Each line is a task</p></li>
<li><p>Lines starting with <strong>#</strong> are comments.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a one-to-one correspondence between the file line number
and the task ID.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible to specify the working directory for each task with
[@ &lt;path&gt; @].</p></li>
<li><p>Use tasks ID to express dependencies at the beginning of the line,
and between brackets and sharps <strong>[# &lt;</strong>list of dependencies goes
here<strong>&gt; #]</strong> .</p></li>
<li><p>And regarding dependencies, remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only backward dependencies are allowed.</li>
<li>Use &#8220;,&#8221; to separate dependencies.</li>
<li>Use &#8220;<strong>-</strong>&#8221; to express a rank of dependencies. i.e.: [# 3&#8211;6
#] means that the current task depends on task 3 though 6
(including both).</li>
<li>Use &#8220;<strong>-</strong>&#8221; also to express relative dependencies. i.e.: [# -1
#] means that the current task depends on the previous task.</li>
<li>You can combine &#8220;<strong>,</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;-&#8221; as you want to separate tokens.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A reference example (example/example.txt) of the syntax could be the
following:</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>    # this line is a comment
    /bin/sleep 2
    # the following task is 4. Tasks IDs 1 and 3 do not exist.
    /bin/sleep 4
    /bin/sleep 5
    /bin/sleep 6
    /bin/sleep 7
    # the following task will be run after completion of the &quot;sleep 5&quot;
    [# 5 #] /bin/sleep 9
    # the following task will be run after completion of the &quot;sleep 9&quot;
    [# -2 #] /bin/sleep 11
    # the following task is invalid because tasks 1 and 3 do not exist
    [#1-3#] /bin/sleep 13
    # the following task will be run after completion of tasks 2, 5, 6 and 7
    [#2, 5 - 7 #] /bin/sleep 15
    # the following task will be executed on the directory /tmp/scratch
    [@ /tmp/scratch @] pwd
    # it is possible to combine dependencies and working directory for a task
    [@ /tmp/scratch @][# -2 #] echo “It works!”
</code></pre>

<h3 id="configuringgreasy">Configuring Greasy</h3>

<p>Greasy is configured using two different methods when it is executed:
the configuration file and environment variables. It is mandatory to
have a valid configuration file with the basic parameters set, and is
located at GREASY_HOME/etc/greasy.conf.</p>

<p>In addition to the file, these parameters can be defined or overridden
by the environment variables. That means that a parameter defined both
in the configuration file and the environment will take the value of the
latter.</p>

<p>Here is a brief summary of the different parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>GreasyEngine</strong>: Specify the engine to use to schedule and run the
jobs. Default is basic.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>basic</em>: It is the standard implementation of the engine. It
only allows local runs unless ssh or Slurm are available in the
system (See BasicRemoteMethod).</li>
<li><em>mpi</em>: MPI implementation of the scheduler. Only available if
MPI is present and enabled at build time. When using this mode,
one cpu will be reserved only for scheduling tasks at runtime.</li>
<li><em>thread</em>: thread implementation for shared memory computers. It
only works in a single node.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>BasicRemoteMethod</strong>: Spawn method for the Basic engine. Values are
<em>ssh</em>, <em>srun</em> or <em>none</em>. If none is set, Basic engine will
only support local runs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>StrictCheck</strong>: This variable controls whether greasy will continue
or stop if any error is found in the tasks file. For example, there
could be syntax errors or tasks with bad dependencies, etc. In such
cases greasy can keep on running and execute the rest of valid
tasks. Of course, these tasks will be marked as invalid and they
will be reported as such at the end. Possible values: <em>yes</em> or
<em>no</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MaxRetries</strong>: Maximum number of retries of a task in case of
failure. If value is 0 or it is not set, then no retries will be
attempted if any task fails. Possible values: a number &gt;= 0.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>LogFile</strong>: Path to the file where the log will be written. If not
set or empty, the log entries will be printed out to standard error.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>LogLevel</strong>: Verbosity of the log. The higher the number is, the
more verbose the output will be. Each level includes the previous
ones. Level 3 is recommended for most cases. Possible values are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>0</em> : Silent mode. No log information will be recorded..</li>
<li><em>1</em> : Error mode. Only fatal errors will be recorded.</li>
<li><em>2</em> : Warning mode. All errors and warnings will be recorded.</li>
<li><em>3</em> : Information mode. Standard information, warnings and
errors will be recorded.</li>
<li><em>4</em> : Debug mode. Information mode + some debug information.</li>
<li><em>5</em> : Developer mode. Debug mode + developer information about
the internals of Greasy. Not recommended for normal use.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Nworkers</strong>: The number of concurrent tasks that will run in
parallel. It is better if defined using environment, as it is much
more flexible across different Greasy executions. At least one
worker has to be defined in order to run Greasy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NodeList</strong>: The list of nodes where Greasy will run tasks for the
basic engine. It has to be at least Nworkers nodes separated by
commas. If not set, Greasy will run only in the local node. Note
that if multiple workers have to run in the same node, that node has
to be in the list as many times as that number of workers per node.
For example, with quad-core nodes, each node in the list should
appear 4 times.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are some considerations regarding the configuration of Greasy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Greasy has native support for Slurm clusters. If Greasy detects that
it is running inside a Slurm job, it will automatically set Nworkers
and NodeList parameters according to the job resources, and will
redirect the log file to greasy-&lt;jobid&gt;.log.</li>
<li>In order to set any parameter via environment, the name of the
variable will be <em>GREASY_</em> followed by the name of the parameter in
uppercase. For example, to change the <em>LogFile</em> parameter, the
corresponding environment variable would be <em>GREASY_LOGFILE</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="runninggreasy">Running Greasy</h3>

<p>There is an example of script to run greasy under <em>example</em> directory in
<em>GREASY_HOME</em>. The best way to get started with Greasy is copying this
example directory to the place where you want to work, and then use the
provided templates to set up your Greasy execution.</p>

<p>Greasy can be run interactively or using a batch system. There is an
example script called <em>bsc_greasy.job</em>, which can be adapted to work
in both ways. If run interactively, the following changes are needed
before launching the script:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set FILE to the path of your task file.</li>
<li>Set the GREASY_NWORKERS and GREASY_NODELIST to the desired values.</li>
<li>Optionally, modify the GREASY_LOGFILE if you want the log to be
written in another file.</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned above, the script is also prepared to be submitted as a BSC
/ RES job using mnsubmit. In this case, some additional modifications to
the script are necessary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the total_tasks directive to the number of workers in the job
(plus one if using MPI engine).</li>
<li>Set the wall_clock_limit directive to the estimate amount of time
to run the entire task file.</li>
<li>There is no need to set GREASY_NWORKERS or GREASY_NODELIST in this
case, since the values will be automatically inferred from job
configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="understandingthelogfile">Understanding the log file</h3>

<p>While Greasy is still running or after its execution, it is a good idea
to check the log. The log provides information of what is being done at
any time, when and where the tasks are executed, and possible errors or
problems occurred during the execution. LogLevel 3 (Information mode) is
recommended as it generates only the minimum useful information. Here is
an example of log records extracted from an execution of the
short-example.txt with 3 workers:</p>

<pre><code>[2012-02-14 16:50:15] Start greasing short-example.txt
[2012-02-14 16:50:15] INFO: BASIC engine is ready to run with 3 workers
[2012-02-14 16:50:15] INFO: Allocating task 1
[2012-02-14 16:50:15] INFO: Allocating task 2
[2012-02-14 16:50:15] INFO: Allocating task 3

[2012-02-14 16:50:35] INFO: Task 1 completed successfully on node lnx.site. Elapsed: 00:00:20
[2012-02-14 16:50:35] INFO: BASIC engine finished
[2012-02-14 16:50:35] INFO: Summary of 3 tasks: 3 OK, 0 FAILED, 0 CANCELLED, 0 INVALID.
[2012-02-14 16:50:35] INFO: Total time: 00:00:20
[2012-02-14 16:50:35] INFO: Resource Utilization: 58.33%
[2012-02-14 16:50:35] Finished greasing short-example.txt
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, every record comes with a timestamp as a prefix, making
easier to understand the behaviour of Greasy and the task scheduling
throughout the whole execution. Having a quick look at the log, we see
that the program started at 16:50:15 and finished at 16:50:35. We can
also observe that the engine used is the default <em>basic</em> and that it is
configured with 3 workers.</p>

<p>Since there are only 3 tasks to allocate and 3 workers, Greasy allocates
all the tasks to all workers at the beginning. Later, Greasy records
tasks completions reporting success or error, the node where the task
was launched and the time it took to run.</p>

<p>Finally, when all tasks have been executed, Greasy shows some statistics
about the execution, such as the tasks completed successfully, the
failures or the canceled tasks. It is also very useful to check the
global elapsed time and the resource utilization. The higher this latter
value is, the more efficiently Greasy used the resources available to
run the tasks. If you feel that this number is too low, consider
changing the number of workers in order to have them busy the maximum
time possible.</p>

<h3 id="somethingwentwrong:therestartfile">Something went wrong: the restart file</h3>

<p>Sometimes things do not work as expected, and it is possible that some
tasks or even the entire Greasy execution finishes abnormally. When that
happens, Greasy generates a restart file containing those tasks that
have failed, have been canceled or have just not been executed. The
restart file is a valid task file for Greasy, so it can be used to run
the tasks that could not run properly the first time. Here is an example
of the restart file, running example.txt:</p>

<pre><code># 
# Greasy restart file generated at 2012-02-14 16:53:50
# Original task file: example.txt
# Log file: greasy.log
#
# Warning: Task 2 failed
/usr/bin/hostname
# Warning: Task 13 was cancelled due to a dependency failure
[# 8 #] /bin/sleep 13
# Warning: Task 15 failed
/usr/bin/hostname
# Warning: Task 22 failed
[ 1 ] /bin/sleep 22
# Warning: Task 24 failed
[ 1 #] /bin/sleep 24
# Invalid tasks were found. Check these lines on example.txt:
# 23, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32
# End of restart file
</code></pre>

<p>There is a little header which provides information about the restart
itself: when it was created, the task file that was being executed and
the log file of the execution. This information is very useful to link
the tasks in the restart with the original execution and figure out what
happened.</p>

<p>When a task was failed or cancelled, Greasy adds a comment identifying
the task in the original file and telling the reason why it is in the
restart. If the task was not able to run because Greasy was told to quit
before, then there will be no comment added. Finally, At the end of the
restart file, if there were invalid tasks in the original task file,
because there were syntax or semantic errors, they are listed with their
corresponding IDs.</p>
